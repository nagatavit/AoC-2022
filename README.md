# Advent of Code - 2022

Learning Rust!

**Warning:** These solutions are pretty ugly and poor and I recommend
that you don't even see them xD. I'm using AoC as a way to force
myself to break the inertia of always saying that someday I will learn
Rust and never start. This repository is not intended as being a good
practices showcase or even something to put in my resume, it is a just
for fun exercise.
